#
#  This assessment item tests your skills at processing data stored in
#  lists, creating reusable code and following instructions to display
#  a complex visual image.  The incomplete Python program below is
#  missing a crucial function, "visualise".  You are required to
#  complete this function so that when the program runs it fills
#  a grid with various symbols, using data stored in a list to
#  determine which symbols to draw and where.  See the various
#  "client requirements" in Blackboard for full details.
#
#  Note that this assessable assignment is in multiple parts,
#  simulating incremental release of instructions by the client.
#  This single template file will be used for all parts and you will
#  submit your final solution as a single Python 3 file only, whether
#  or not you complete all requirements for the assignment.
